#.cursorrules – AI as a Staff+ Engineer

> A production-ready `.cursorrules` template that makes AI code like a disciplined Staff+ engineer — **plan → implement → test → verify → document.**

---

## 🚀 Why This Exists

Most developers let AI spit out random code.  
But great developers **teach AI their standards**.

This `.cursorrules` file turns AI (in [Cursor](https://cursor.sh)) into a reliable senior teammate.  
Instead of ad-hoc prompts, the AI now:

- 📋 **Plans first** — defines intent, files, schemas, risks  
- ⚡ **Implements safely** — small diffs, pure functions, clean code  
- ✅ **Adds tests** — unit/integration, edge cases, failure paths  
- 🔍 **Verifies** — shows commands, risks, rollback notes  
- 📝 **Documents** — updates README, `.env.example`, commits  

---

## 📂 What’s Inside

The rules cover:

- **Operating principles** → small safe steps, tests & docs mandatory  
- **Task Execution Protocol** → 5-step loop for every change  
- **Code Style** → TypeScript strict, Zod, React/Next.js/Expo best practices  
- **Security & Quality** → input validation, RLS, no secrets in code  
- **Testing Standards** → Vitest/Jest, RTL, E2E flows  
- **Git & PRs** → Conventional Commits, safe migrations, PR checklists  
- **Folder Layout** → web (Next.js) & mobile (Expo) conventions  
- **Templates** → API routes, Axios client, React components, RN screens

## 📖 Usage

1. Copy `.cursorrules` into the root of your repo.  
2. Open your project in [Cursor](https://cursor.sh).  
3. The AI will now follow your engineering rules automatically.
